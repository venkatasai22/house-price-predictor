- Easy-to-use interface

## Tech Stack
- Python
- scikit-learn (Linear Regression)
- Flask or Streamlit (Web interface)
- Pandas, Matplotlib

## How It Works
1. User inputs features (location, size, etc.)
2. The ML model predicts rent using trained data
3. Results are shown on the UI with charts

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py  # for Flask
